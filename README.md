This project from the Odin Project course consists of building a website from scratch that has a particular pre-designed layout that I must achieve.

I have a screenshot of the design, and been informed of what the font to use is.

To accomplish this, I will have to fully utilise everything the lessons have covered so far, including html, css and flexbox elements.
